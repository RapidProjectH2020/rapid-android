/**
 * Enables fine-tuning project details (.project file) of the Eclipse plugin
 * <p>
 * Example of use with a blend of all possible properties.
 * Bear in mind that usually you don't have configure eclipse project directly because Gradle configures it for free!
 *
 * <pre autoTested=''>
 * apply plugin: 'java'
 * apply plugin: 'eclipse'
 *
 * eclipse {
 *   project {
 *     //if you don't like the name Gradle has chosen
 *     name = 'someBetterName'
 *
 *     //if you want to specify the Eclipse project's comment
 *     comment = 'Very interesting top secret project'
 *
 *     //if you want to append some extra referenced projects in a declarative fashion:
 *     referencedProjects 'someProject', 'someOtherProject'
 *     //if you want to assign referenced projects
 *     referencedProjects = ['someProject'] as Set
 *
 *     //if you want to append some extra natures in a declarative fashion:
 *     natures 'some.extra.eclipse.nature', 'some.another.interesting.nature'
 *     //if you want to assign natures in a groovy fashion:
 *     natures = ['some.extra.eclipse.nature', 'some.another.interesting.nature']
 *
 *     //if you want to append some extra build command:
 *     buildCommand 'buildThisLovelyProject'
 *     //if you want to append a build command with parameters:
 *     buildCommand 'buildItWithTheArguments', argumentOne: "I'm first", argumentTwo: "I'm second"
 *
 *     //if you want to create an extra link in the eclipse project,
 *     //by location uri:
 *     linkedResource name: 'someLinkByLocationUri', type: 'someLinkType', locationUri: 'file://someUri'
 *     //by location:
 *     linkedResource name: 'someLinkByLocation', type: 'someLinkType', location: '/some/location'
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * For tackling edge cases users can perform advanced configuration on resulting XML file.
 * It is also possible to affect the way eclipse plugin merges the existing configuration
 * via beforeMerged and whenMerged closures.
 * <p>
 * beforeMerged and whenMerged closures receive {@link Project} object
 * <p>
 * Examples of advanced configuration:
 *
 * <pre autoTested=''>
 * apply plugin: 'java'
 * apply plugin: 'eclipse'
 *
 * eclipse {
 *   project {
 *
 *     file {
 *       //if you want to mess with the resulting XML in whatever way you fancy
 *       withXml {
 *         def node = it.asNode()
 *         node.appendNode('xml', 'is what I love')
 *       }
 *
 *       //closure executed after .project content is loaded from existing file
 *       //but before gradle build information is merged
 *       beforeMerged { project ->
 *         //if you want skip merging natures... (a very abstract example)
 *         project.natures.clear()
 *       }
 *
 *       //closure executed after .project content is loaded from existing file
 *       //and after gradle build information is merged
 *       whenMerged { project ->
 *         //you can tinker with the {@link Project} here
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }

     * Configures eclipse project name. It is <b>optional</b> because the task should configure it correctly for you.
     * By default it will try to use the <b>project.name</b> or prefix it with a part of a <b>project.path</b>
     * to make sure the moduleName is unique in the scope of a multi-module build.
     * The 'uniqueness' of a module name is required for correct import
     * into Eclipse and the task will make sure the name is unique.
     * <p>
     * The logic that makes sure project names are unique is available <b>since</b> 1.0-milestone-2
     * <p>
     * If your project has problems with unique names it is recommended to always run gradle eclipse from the root, e.g. for all subprojects, including generation of .classpath.
     * If you run the generation of the eclipse project only for a single subproject then you may have different results
     * because the unique names are calculated based on eclipse projects that are involved in the specific build run.
     * <p>
     * If you update the project names then make sure you run gradle eclipse from the root, e.g. for all subprojects.
     * The reason is that there may be subprojects that depend on the subproject with amended eclipse project name.
     * So you want them to be generated as well because the project dependencies in .classpath need to refer to the amended project name.
     * Basically, for non-trivial projects it is recommended to always run gradle eclipse from the root.
