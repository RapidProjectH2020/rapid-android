/**
 * An extension for configuring the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Runner">Sonar Runner</a> integration.
 * <p>
 * The extension is added to all projects that have the {@code "sonar-runner"} plugin applied, and all of their subprojects.
 * The extension of the project that actually applies the {@code "sonar-runner"} plugin is a subclass of this type, {@link SonarRunnerRootExtension},
 * which also allows configuration of the Sonar Runner process.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre autoTested=''>
 * sonarRunner {
 *   skipProject = false // this is the default
 *   sonarProperties {
 *     property "sonar.host.url", "http://my.sonar.server" // adding a single property
 *     properties mapOfProperties // adding multiple properties at once
 *     properties["sonar.sources"] += sourceSets.other.java.srcDirs // manipulating an existing property }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <h3>Sonar Properties</h3>
 * <p>
 * The Sonar configuration is provided by using the {@link #sonarProperties(org.gradle.api.Action)} method and specifying properties.
 * Certain properties are required, such as {@code "sonar.host.url"} which provides the address of the Sonar server.
 * For details on what properties are available, see <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Analysis+Parameters">Analysis Parameters</a> in the Sonar documentation.
 * <p>
 * The {@code "sonar-runner"} plugin adds default values for several plugins dependening on the nature of the project.
 * Please see the “Sonar Runner Plugin” chapter of the Gradle User Guide for details on which properties are set and their values.
 * <p>
 * Please see the {@link SonarProperties} class for more information on the mechanics of setting Sonar properties, including laziness and property types.
 *
 * @deprecated The 'sonar-runner' plugin has been superseded by the official plugin from SonarQube, please see: http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analyzing+with+Gradle

     * This is mainly useful for global SonarQube properties like database credentials.
     * Every system property starting with {@code "sonar."} is automatically set on the "root" project of the SonarQube run (i.e. the project that has the {@code sonar-runner} plugin applied).
     * System properties take precedence over properties declared in build scripts.
